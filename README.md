# Exercice for Reezocar

My mission for this exercice was to integrate the maximum of this [design](https://www.figma.com/file/sBiTPmzMVssXByaAUFtfHd/MR-Test?node-id=0%3A1) in 1 or 2 days maximum. In 2 days I integrated it till the section `Les dernières annonces publiées`.

If you want to run the project you can run the following command.

```bash
npm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open your browser to this adress: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

# Improvements

This project can be improved by :

- documenting the code (react component, custom method ...) with jsdoc
- handling text translation with i18n
- finishing the web page integration if more time will be allowed

Feel free to contact me in case of needs.
